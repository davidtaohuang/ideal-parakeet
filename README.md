AKA qmk_firmware_keymaps

## Background

As the new proud owner of a HotDox 76; I'm currently going through the process of manually creating a keymap using the QMK firmware and hopefully manually flashing it since the QMK Toolbox method didn't work for me. I figured that since I'm going through all of this work anyway, I might as well share the end result with you all, so I hope you enjoy!
